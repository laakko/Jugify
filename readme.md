# Jugify

(*Work in progress*)

An Android application for better Spotify experience.  
This is based on my experiences as a daily user of the Spotify application:  
I felt some features were missing from the application, and on the other hand, some features I've never used, that were just bloating the UI.  
For this application, I removed those features that I didn't need, added some new features and streamlined the UI 
to make my most used features more easily accessible. 

**Features**:
- New functionality: interesting data on user's listening habits: top artists, tracks and genres, etc. on various timelines  
- Minimalistic UI, intuitive swipe-to-change-tab layout.  
- Unnecessary features removed
- Easy and quick access to saved playlists, albums and favorite artists; just one click away
- Musical information on currently playing track: view estimates of key, tempo, loudness and time signature!
- Song lyrics! One of my favourite features, that was removed from the official Spotify application, is back
- Artist exploration page: discover new music based on your interests
